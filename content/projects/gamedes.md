<!-- Outline -->
## Background
Diet dash is a 5 player board game where players roll a die to advance the board. The first player to reach the end wins the game. Players have their own unique diets, which indicate their preferred meals. These meals are shown as cards. There are ingredient cards that players can use to progress faster or slow down others' players progress. These ingredient cards can also be used to craft more powerful cards called dish cards. 

## Design process
<!-- cards -->
Since this game has a culinary and casual theme, a bright color scheme is appropriate. Examples of colorful reference material were Recipe Craft, Machi Koro, and Exploding Kittens.

There are two types of cards, ingredient and dish cards. Ingredient cards have an icon, description, and its associated effects to certain players. These effects can either force players to move forward or backward 3 tiles as seen on the corner of the cards. Dish cards have similar designs to ingredient cards. The difference is dish cards show the ingredients required to make the dish. We started with simple mockups to place these elements in the best position possible. The cards used food icons from Flaticon and followed its color scheme. There were several iterations on the cards until we have landed on this final design. 


For the board, we also started with a simple mockup. It is a 10x10 grid that has starting and finish points. The board also featured colored tiles that are in random places. These tiles positively or negatively affect players when they land on them. Once we were happy with the mockup, the board's theme was later updated to be inside a restaurant. The plates in a conveyor belt serve as tiles for players to land into. Some plates were then colored to represent the colored tiles. Dining tables, signboards, and chefs were added as decorations.


## Learnings and feedback
Our professor complimented our card and board designs for being simple and clean. For example, he liked the use of negative space or empty space on the cards. Additionally, he liked that color of the empty space matched that of the food icon. Though he suggested that the arrows should be replaced to numbers, which show the number of steps. He noted that the board is quite big, though it is not a big issue.
