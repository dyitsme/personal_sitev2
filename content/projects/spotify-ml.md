## About project

A case study that examines that popularities across several genres using regression models such as `linear regresion`, `logistic regression`, and `neural networks`. It used the spotify music dataset which is composed of 17,996 songs. The hyperparameters were tuned by using grid search, thus increasing the performance of these models.

| Track Name         | Name of song                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Popularity         | a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity<br>is calculated by an algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays<br>the track has had and how recent those plays are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| danceability       | describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of<br>musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.<br>A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| energy             | a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and<br>activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal<br>has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features<br>contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset<br>rate, and general entropy.                                                                                                                            |
| key                | The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.<br>If no key was detected, the value is -1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| loudness           | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged<br>across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness<br>is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength<br>(amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| mode               | indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its<br>melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| speechiness        | detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively<br>speech-like the recording (e.g., talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the<br>attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of<br>spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both<br>music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music.<br>Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |
| acousticness       | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0<br>represents high confidence the track is acoustic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| instrumentalness   | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds<br>are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal".<br>The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains<br>no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but<br>confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.                                                                                                         |
| liveness           | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values<br>represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8<br>provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| valence            | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a<br>track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g., happy, cheerful, euphoric),<br>while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g., sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| tempo              | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical<br>terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the<br>average beat duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| duration_in min/ms | Duration in ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| time_signature     | An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational<br>convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature<br>ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of “3/4”, to “7/4”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Class              | corresponds to the genre of the track.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
