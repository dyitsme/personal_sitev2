This website is used to perform binary multiplication on binary and decimal inputs with the use of the sequential circuit.

Follow the steps accordingly if you wish to be guided:

1. Select your input type using the radio buttons under "Number Type"
  "Binary" for signed binary inputs.
  "Decimal" for regular decimal inputs.

2. Type your multiplicand in M and multiplier in Q.
  Your input must be within 4 to 16 bits and must be a valid binary number. This also applies for decimal inputs.
  If your input exceeds 16 bits, you will need to try again, however if your input is shorter than 4 bits, the program automatically extends your input to 4 bits.
  For negative decimal inputs, just type one '-' followed by the number (how you would typically write a negative decimal number).

3. Select your output type:
  "Step-by-step" prints explanations of each step in an orderly manner.
  "All" prints the complete solution immediately with minimal explanation.
  "File" prints all of the output text to a file which can be downloaded.
4. Press "Enter" and check the results.
5. You may repeat with a new input or use the same input for a different output type.
